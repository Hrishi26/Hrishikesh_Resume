\section{PROJECTS} 


\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{Vehiclular Accident prevention system} \hfill \(Feb,18 - April,18\)\\
   \textbf{based on Cognitive driving Distraction}\\
   Worked as the Technical Head, to develop a system that works towards prevention of accidents caused mainly due to human errors by monitoring the driver's behavioural and physiological features like Drowsiness, Stress, Anxiety and influence of Alcohol and then takes preventive actions.\\

\item \textbf{Collector Bot: e-Yantra Robotics Compeition} \hfill \(Oct,17 - March,18\)\\
   Worked on Image Processing using Python OpenCV, Path Planning and motion planning in V-Rep, implementing PID algorithm and Robot Structure design. \\The theme of this project is to detect and collect fruits in shortest possible time, using efficient paths to avoid collisions with obstacles. \\

   \item \textbf{High-Resolution Microstepping Controller }                           \hfill \(Dec,2017-Jan,2018\)\\
This project involves designing a High-resolution Microstepping Controller to implement Microstepping which is a way of moving the stator flux of a stepper more smoothly than in full- or half-step drive modes, used to achieve higher resolution or smoother motion at low speeds.  \\

   \item \textbf{4G Technology Based Data Acquisition System}                     \hfill             \(Aug,2017-Nov,2017\)\\
The system involves a SIM7100 4G module interfaced to an Atmega8535 Microcontroller, where the current output of a remote system is measured using a Hall effect based sensor and this data is logged \& stored in an SD card, and the efficiency of the Machines is calculated and relevant SMS alerts are sent using 4G technology. 


\item \textbf{ e-Nirogya : an IoT based Health Care System}                     \hfill             \(Jan,2017-July,2017\)\\
e-Nirogya is a remote health monitoring system for Rural Areas which uses a Raspberry Pi as the Central processor to collect Critical Health parameter data for remote diagnosis of diseases and immediate medical consultation from Urban Doctors.\\
Worked as the Technical Head,developed and implemented the Hardware System and mechanism for uploading data from remote locations and performing Online Data Analytics.
